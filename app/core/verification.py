"""The verification gate.

Every extracted value passes through here before it reaches confidence scoring or
the callback. One choke point, so rejection is testable and auditable in a single
place.

Policy, decided deliberately: a value that fails verification is set to ``None``,
not merely marked low-confidence. A fabricated total with confidence 0.4 still
enters the financial system; a null routes the receipt to a human. Rejections are
recorded so the decision can be audited afterwards.
