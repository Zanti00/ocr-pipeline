"""Money resolution and arithmetic reconciliation.

Money has internal structure a model cannot fake consistently, which makes it the
strongest hallucination detector available. A guessed total will not satisfy
``net + tax + charges = total``; a correctly read one will.

Reconciliation is locale-parameterised. PH VAT is a fixed 12% and inclusive, so
the identity is a hard assertion. US sales tax is exclusive and varies by state,
so only the weaker additive identity is checked and the rate is derived rather
than validated.
