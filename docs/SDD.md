# System Design Document (SDD): OCR Pipeline

## 1. System Components & Subsystems
The OCR Pipeline is structured into three primary subsystems that handle requests, manage background workers, and store data asynchronously.

```
+--------------------------------------------------------+
|                      OCR Pipeline                      |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
|   1. API Layer   |   2. Task Queue  |  3. Data Layer   |
|     FastAPI      |   Celery Workers | MongoDB/Postgres |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
```

### 1.1. API Gateway / Router Layer (FastAPI)
Acts as the entry point for all service-to-service communication. Exposes endpoints for scheduling OCR jobs, checking duplicate status, and tracking long-running tasks.
- **`/api/ocr/process` (POST):** Receives file URLs and webhook callback metadata; validates the request, generates a `job_id`, updates MongoDB status to `queued`, and dispatches a Celery task.
- **`/api/duplicate-check` (POST):** Synchronously accepts text or metadata to check for duplicates in the pgvector database.
- **`/api/jobs/{job_id}/status` (GET):** Reads MongoDB to check current job processing state (`queued`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`).
- **`/health` (GET):** Checks availability of Redis, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
- **`/metrics` (GET):** Exposes Prometheus/Application-level metrics.

### 1.2. Asynchronous Processing Worker Layer (Celery)
Consists of dedicated background workers running Celery to isolate heavy CPU/Memory operations.
- **`process_receipt_task`:** 
  1. Retrieves receipt bytes from Redis ephemeral byte cache (`ocr:file_bytes:<sha256>`), falling back to network download (S3/Supabase) on cache miss. Checks 90-day SHA-256 result cache (`ocr:file_hash:<sha256>`); if hit, bypasses OCR extraction and immediately executes vector embedding, duplicate detection, persistence, and webhook callback.
  2. Applies OpenCV filters (e.g., adaptive thresholding, deskewing).
  3. **Fast path (early exit):** runs a single cheap Tesseract pass over the preprocessed image (`read_fast`, PSM 6). If the reading's receipt-aware anchor score clears `FAST_PATH_ANCHOR_SCORE` (6.0), extraction runs against this single pass; when the money reconciles AND a total is present (`fast_path_sufficient`), the receipt ships immediately — skipping the multi-pass pool entirely. When the first pass scores below the threshold, a second cheap pass (`read_fast_fallback`) over the `flat` rendering at PSM 11 gets one more try before the pool, rescuing clean receipts whose best-effort rendering degrades (e.g. deskew/denoise hurting that particular image). Otherwise the worker **escalates**: PaddleOCR and the full Tesseract variant × PSM pool run concurrently, selecting the strongest reading by anchor scoring while retaining all candidates for amount/item reconciliation; failed engines degrade independently. PaddleOCR receives the orientation-corrected image (`correct_orientation`), ensuring sideways (90°/270°) captures are read upright. Tall/narrow receipts (aspect ≥ 2.0, e.g. long grocery POS slips) get `text_det_limit_side_len=512` in `read_paddle` — measured ~30% faster with identical line/character output (the default 960px limit blows the internal image up to ~3820px). Supporting readings scoring below `primary.score / 2.0` are dropped from `combined_text` so Tesseract garbage never pollutes the LLM prompt. Item parsing handles price-first grocery layouts (`64.00 V` / `1 × 64.00` / barcode + store code) via a pending-item mechanism, and store-code names (uppercase + mixed alphanumeric tokens like `EP025G`) are kept verbatim — exempt from dictionary and LLM normalization.
  4. Generates a 384-dimensional semantic embedding via `sentence-transformers` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) — computed **once** per job and reused for both duplicate detection and pgvector storage.
  5. Stores raw text, confidence, and metadata in MongoDB.
  6. Inserts the embedding vector into PostgreSQL.
  7. Performs a duplicate lookup via pgvector.
  8. Triggers the callback webhook to post results back to the caller.

### 1.3. Persistence & Cache Layer
- **Redis:** Message broker for Celery, ephemeral byte handoff cache (`ocr:file_bytes:<url_sha256>`, TTL 10m) between API validation and Celery worker execution, and 90-day SHA-256 result cache (`ocr:file_hash:<content_sha256>`).
- **MongoDB:** Flexible metadata storage. No relational constraints, allowing arbitrary line items, confidence scores, and raw OCR outputs to be stored as a single document.
- **PostgreSQL (with pgvector):** Primary relational engine storing document embeddings and executing cosine similarity queries.

## 2. Data Flow & Integration Points

### 2.1. Ingestion & Processing Data Flow
The sequence diagram below represents the end-to-end lifecycle of a receipt upload and OCR processing workflow:

    participant API as OCR FastAPI API
    participant Queue as Redis Message Queue

    Caller->>API: POST /api/ocr/process {file_url, callback_url, receipt_id} (X-API-KEY header)
    API->>API: Verify API Key
    API->>DB: Create job entry (status: queued)

    API-->>Caller: 202 Accepted {job_id, status: queued}

    Worker->>API: Update job status (processing)
    Worker->>Worker: Download file & Run OpenCV Pre-processing
    Worker->>Worker: Run PaddleOCR + Tesseract candidate selection
    Worker->>Worker: Run Sentence-Transformers (Create Vector)
    Worker->>DB: Save raw text & metadata (Mongo) and Vector (Postgres)
    Worker->>Worker: Perform duplicate detection in PostgreSQL pgvector
    Worker->>Caller: POST callback_url {job_id, ocr_data, duplicate_found} (X-API-KEY header)
    Worker->>DB: Update job status (completed)
```

### 2.2. Authentication & Security
- **Service-to-Service Authentication:** All REST API endpoints require a pre-shared API Key passed in the `X-API-KEY` HTTP header. 
- **Webhook Security:** Outbound webhook callbacks sent from the Celery workers to the upstream caller also attach the `X-API-KEY` header to authenticate the payload on the receiver's end.
- **CORS Settings:** No CORS configuration is exposed or permitted because this service is solely accessed backend-to-backend. No browser clients communicate directly with the OCR Pipeline.

Colocated with the warm-model settings, the provider bounds what it feeds the model: only the receipt header (~3500 chars) plus a fixed totals tail (~2500 chars) are sent for selection/semantics/subtotal calls (`_bound_context`), dropping the long itemized middle that would otherwise tax CPU prefill with noise. Vendor/location names live in the header and totals/tax wording in the footer, so bounding preserves the regions the model actually answers from.

## 2.3 Financial semantics stage
After deterministic baseline extraction, the worker conditionally asks the configured Ollama model (`qwen3:1.7b`, non-thinking JSON mode) for **one consolidated structured response** covering vendor choice, location, tax/currency semantics, and subtotal verification — a single bounded generation replaces up to four separate calls (on CPU-only Ollama each generation costs tens of seconds and concurrent calls serialize on the model queue). The prompt permits only tax basis, confidence/evidence, currency, closed-list vendor/location picks, and a subtotal; it cannot invent amounts outside the offered lists. Every field is validated by the caller against its closed list before use, so a wrong answer stays bounded and a hallucinated one is rejected exactly as before.

Responses are accepted only at confidence >= 0.75 with evidence grounded in OCR and otherwise fail soft. The fast path deliberately skips the model (dictionary-only normalization, `use_llm=False`): when a single pass reconciles the receipt it does so without paying the LLM round trip.

Deterministic receipt wording and grounded arithmetic outrank the model. Caller context outranks receipt/OCR context; country is only a fallback prior. The final deterministic extraction is rerun with accepted semantics before verification and reconciliation. Exclusive receipts may use an independently grounded net/subtotal plus tax to compute a callback total; unknown basis never authorizes that substitution.

Tax-basis fallbacks are per-country so Malaysian receipts stay deterministic offline: `MY` receipts carrying `SST`/`GST` wording are treated as exclusive (tax added on top of the subtotal), which lets `total_sales = net + tax` derive even when the model assist is unavailable. Currency detection ignores the `Sdn. Bhd.` company suffix (a common Malaysian register suffix) so it is never misread as the `BHD` currency code. Invoice-number lookup accepts semicolon and comma separators in addition to `:`, `.`, and `#`, because fast-path single-pass OCR frequently transcribes `Invoice number; 12345` and `No, 38326`.

## 2.4 Multi-Segment & Long Receipt Pipeline
Long thermal receipts (e.g., supermarket runs with 20–100+ items) frequently present either as multiple overlapping uploaded photos (`file_urls`) or a single high-aspect-ratio panorama. Processing them through monolithic image stitching or single-pass detector resize causes acute issues: duplicated seam items, detector downscaling blur, and Tesseract thread thrashing on anchorless middle segments.

The long-receipt pipeline addresses this via:
1. **Parallel Ingestion & 3-Zone Quality Check:** All segments download concurrently via `asyncio.gather`. Tall images (`height >= 2.0 * width`) undergo 3-zone Laplacian variance checks (top, middle, bottom) so localized camera defocus or motion blur is caught before OCR.
2. **Segment Density Scoring & Auto-Ordering:** Each segment is scored for `header_score`, `body_score`, and `footer_score` based on tax anchors (`TIN`, `Date`, `Invoice`), item density (`x`, `@`, decimal prices), and payment summaries (`Subtotal`, `Cash`, `Change`). Segments are ordered topologically `(header -> body segments -> footer)` with seam text chaining, falling back to caller order if ambiguous.
3. **Density-Aware Fast-Path:** Middle segments typically contain dense item rows with zero header anchors. Standard fast-path anchor requirements (`score >= 6.0`) are relaxed for middle segments that show dense item structure (`>= 5` item lines, confidence `>= 0.70`), allowing them to complete in the fast-path stage without escalation.
4. **Text-Level Seam Deduplication:** Instead of pixel-level image stitching, each segment is OCR-read independently in parallel. Text lines from successive segments are aligned at the seam using normalized text similarity and amount matching. Overlapping seam rows are deduplicated with pixel coordinate translation (`top_offset`), producing a seamless vertical reading while eliminating duplicate items.
5. **Virtual Strip Tiling for Tall Images:** When a single tall receipt (`height >= 1800` and `aspect_ratio >= 2.8`) is received and `ocr_virtual_tiling` is enabled, it is automatically sliced into overlapping strips (1200–1400px height with 150px vertical overlap). Each strip is OCR'd and stitched via text-level seam deduplication, keeping horizontal resolution crisp without triggering detector downscaling.
6. **Split-Line & Multi-Token Grocery Parsing:** Item parser handles split-line and inline grocery formats where the quantity line precedes, follows, or accompanies the price line (`2 x 14.75` or `2 @ 14.75` before/after/inline with `29.50 V`), correctly associating unit price, line total, and item barcode/description.
7. **Near-Reconciliation & Closest-Basis Selection:** For receipts with `>= 3` items, if line items sum within `<= 3%` of printed subtotal/total, the items are emitted with `near_reconciled = True`, and the composite confidence score is capped at `0.79` (`REASON_NEAR_RECONCILED`). Even when unreconciled, the parser selects the price basis (`unit_price` vs `line_total`) closest to the target total so unit prices are multiplied by quantity appropriately.
